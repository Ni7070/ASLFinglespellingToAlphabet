# ASLFinglespellingToAlphabet
Fingerspelling is a subset of sign language used for communication by representing a word or other expression by rendering its written form letter by letter in a manual alphabet. It is a method of spelling words using hand movements. 
In this project, we have worked with 26 different letters and 3 different symbols of daily use of the English language. We are making a system that can recognize hand symbols and give us the corresponding meaning as output. 
This project was made using Kaggle dataset "kaggle datasets download -d grassknoted/asl-alphabet"
